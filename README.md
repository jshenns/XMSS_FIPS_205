This is a repository for a VHDL implementation of the XMSS component of SPHINCS+, as specified in FIPS-205. Please note that this is a work in progress, and is my senior design project. We have yet to add addressing or random number generation.
Full credit to secworks on github whose SHA-256 hardware implementation and python code we are using in our project.
